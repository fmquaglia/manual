In addition to Python, a Node.js runtime is now supported in DETA.

To get started, simply fork one of our Node.js examples from the `START` menu or type the following into the DETA Teletype:

```ruby
new <prog_name> -js
```
<br />

DETA brings the same experience of simple plug and play modules to Node.js.

* Packages can be [installed via npm](/node/packages/).
* Use [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Koa](https://koajs.com/) for [http routing](/node/frameworks/).
* Code can be [scheduled via cron](/node/lib/cron/).
* Run your programs from [Teletype](/node/lib/run/).

You can also access resources via `deta.lib`:

* [Database](/node/resources/database)
* [Files](/node/resources/files)
* [Email](/node/resources/email)

If you have any questions, please [contact us](/contact)!
