## Spaces

Spaces are a place for individuals and teams to create, update, and run programs.



## Programs

You can create, open, modify, and run programs. 

Programs are made up of files.



## Files

You can edit files within an open program. Once you have changed file(s) you can deploy these changes.

The file which controls a program's execution is main.py, it is programmed to receive.

You can edit other files as you like, but main.py will never leave.



## The Console

The console is a page in DETA that lets you create, edit, and run programs.

The console is comprised of the DETA canvas, the DETA Teletype, output views, a configuration panel, and a stream of logs.

### The Canvas

The canvas is DETA's text editor.


### The DETA Teletype

A list of valid commands for the DETA Teletype is [here](./teletype.md).

### The Config Panel

The config panel is made up of a file browser, program specific information, and a permissions tab.

### Output Views

#### Teletype Output

The Teletype output displays primarily outputs and errors from running programs triggered in the Teletype.

#### GET Request

The GET request output view executes a GET request to your DETA program. You can add optional params into the URL bar.

If you deploy changes to your program this view will update in real-time, running the new program.

### Logs

The Logs section streams logs from running programs.
