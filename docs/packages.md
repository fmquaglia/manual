# Packages

Installing packages via pip is currently possible in DETA.

However, the DETA package manager is under heavy development and performance has room for improvement.

See the `pip` commands in the [DETA Teletype](./teletype.md) for a complete description of options.

A program's installed packages can be viewed in the 'INFO' pane under `deps` at the bottom of the DETA console.
