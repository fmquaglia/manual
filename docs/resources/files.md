    DETA Library `deta.lib` is still work in progress and we will keep improving it in the coming weeks and months.
    If there's a method or feature you _really_ need, send us an email.


Deta Cloud Files is a fully managed file and object storage service that comes in handy when storing files of all sizes.

To use DETA Cloud Files just import the `files` helper from `deta.lib`:

```python
from deta.lib import files
```
Then use one of the following four methods below.

### Put

**`files.put(name, content)`**: store a text file or binary object.

* **`name`** is the object's name, it must be a string.
*  **`content`** is the object's content, it can be string, bytes or [file object](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/io.html).

You can store files in multiple "directories" by prefixing the name of the file with the desired directory name, e.g. `"reports/may.pdf"`.

##### Code Examples
```python
# storing simple text
files.put('cheese.md', "# Deutscher KÃ¤se ist...")

# inside a directory
files.put("notes/day14.txt", "We did...")

# storing bytes
files.put('numbers', b"0123456789")

# storing an image
with open("/tmp/photo.png", "rb") as f:
    files.put("photo.png", f)

# storing a text file
with open("/tmp/emails.csv") as f:
    files.put("emails.csv", f)
```

<br />

### Get

**`files.get(name)`** retrieves a file based on file name or path if it lives inside a directory.

* **`name`** string
* return value:
    * a `StreamingBody` class will be streamed back if an object is found with the provided `name`. 
    * `None` will be returned, if there is no object found with the provided `name`. 

##### Code Example

```python
files.get("todos/week2/monday.md")
```

Use the following methods to read your data from a **`StreamingBody`** class:

* **`read(amt=None)`**: 
    * Read the data stream. Use `amt` (amount) value to limit the byte chunks you want to receive at a time (*useful for large files*). Leave it empty if you want to receive all the bytes at once.

* **`iter_chunks(chunk_size=1024)`**: 
    * Return an iterator to yield chunks of `chunk_size` bytes from the raw stream.

* **`next()`**: 
    * Return the next 1k chunk from the raw stream.


* **`set_socket_timeout(timeout)`**: 
    * Set the timeout (in seconds) on the socket.

* **`close()`**: 
    * Close the underlying response stream.

##### Code Example

```python
text = files.get("hello.txt").read()
```

<br />

### List

for listing all your files or files in a specific directory:

**`files.list(dir=None)`** lists all uploaded files. Provide the directory name to get the files inside it.

##### Code Examples

```python
 # returns a list of all uploaded files (for the current program)
files.list()

# returns a list of files inside the notes directory
files.list("notes")
files.list("notes/september")
```

<br />

### Delete


**`files.delete(name)`** delete a single file from DETA Cloud files.

##### Code Examples

```python
files.delete("notes.md")
files.delete("notes/september/1.txt")
```
