# Getting Started
!!! important
    DETA is still alpha – expect bugs and breaking changes.


> *DETA `ˈdɛtə` — pronounced like "meta".*

DETA is a cloud computer that gets your programs up and running <mark>*blazingly fast*</mark>. It lets you focus on writing code and takes care of everything else. 

No servers or databases to set-up or maintain and no lengthy docs – just you, your idea and Python. You can also bring your team along for the ride if you like.

## Tour

!!! Note
    This video is slightly dated. From DETA lib version `21` in Python the convention for the decorated functions is `app.lib.x`. For all earlier lib versions the convention is `app.x`. You can find a program's lib version by the `deta.lib` field in the `INFO` tab. The latest lib version is `22`.
