# Getting Started
!!! important
    DETA is still alpha – expect bugs and breaking changes.


> *DETA `ˈdɛtə` — pronounced like "meta".*

DETA is a cloud computer that gets your programs running <mark>*blazingly fast*</mark>. It lets you focus on writing code and takes care of everything else. 

No servers or databases to set-up or maintain and no lengthy docs – just you, your idea and Python. You can also bring your team along for the ride if you like.
