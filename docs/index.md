    DETA is still alpha – expect bugs and breaking changes.


> *DETA `ˈdɛtə` — pronounced like "meta".*

DETA helps you develop programs <mark>*blazingly fast*</mark>. It lets you focus on writing code and takes care of everything else. 

No servers to set-up or maintain, no databases, no lengthy docs – just you, your idea and Python.

1. [Contact us](/contact), we're happy to personally guide you.
2. Watch this video to get started.
3. A (config-less) [Database](/resources/database), a [File Store](/resources/files) and an [Email Service](/resources/email) are built in.
4. Your programs are *instantly usable*: run via [Teletype](/use/run), call via [HTTP](/use/http) or trigger via [Cron Scheduler](/use/cron).
